#Lab 06 TCP server

Create a TCP server module that will allow for the following actions:

/List : this will provide a list of current users\n
/Quit will close the socket\n
/Nick <new nickname> this will allow the user to change their nickname\n
/DM <recipient> <message> this will allow a direct message between users.\n

The user needs to ```npm install```
The user needs to ```nc localhost 3000``` to connect to the server.
